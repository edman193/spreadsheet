## Development

### Setup project locally
In development, when editing js files you will need to [link your local repository](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/)
and run [webpack-dev-server script from `webpacker`](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#development) in your rails application

In brief, the process is 2 steps:
* Run `yarn link` in this directory.
* Run `yarn link "spreadsheet"` in the project that has the dependency.
